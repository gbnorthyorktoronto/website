              Our team color is the red, our team flag is the Red Shield. The Red Shield connects the
              Gracie Barra community, our students taking their first class, our Black Belts graduating,
              our athletes in battle, our instructors teaching, our Schools keeping the legacy alive.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Red Shield was created by Master Carlos Gracie Jr. with the purpose of unifying all
              of those who represent Gracie Barra, defend the Red Shield and pass forward the legacy
              transferred down from Grandmaster Carlos Gracie, and other Jiu-Jitsu legends such as HÃ©lio
              Gracie, Rolles Gracie and Carlos Gracie Jr.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Red Shield&apos;s credibility was built over the years through hard work and excellence
              shown by the Gracie Barra students, athletes and instructors involved in sport Jiu-Jitsu
              competitions, teaching programs and community work. The Gracie Barra Red Shield is one of
              the most recognized symbols in Jiu-Jitsu today and all of those who carry it feel a deep
              sense of loyalty and commitment to Master Carlos Gracie Jr, Gracie Barra and the Jiu-Jitsu
              for Everyone movement.

              Athletics at Gracie Barra North York is represented by a sport Jiu-Jitsu competition team
              known as EQUIPE GB. Athletics within Gracie Barra builds community and pride through the
              engagement of students, staff, parents, and friends, and creates a portal through which
              everyone can enjoy the GB experience. Successful athletic performance generates a unique
              excitement across the Gracie Barra Schools and community, help strengthen bonds among the
              various arms of our organization, build students loyalty in a healthy manner, and give
              Gracie Barra members yet another reason to be proud to represent the legacy of Master
              Carlos Gracie Jr. and defend the red shield.
              <br />
              <br />
              Athletic participation helps Gracie Barra students grow, learn, and enjoy themselves
              while developing their body, mind and spirit. Our competition team, values the lessons
              that have long been taught by sport Jiu-Jitsu competitions: the pursuit of excellence
              through personal development and teamwork, ethical and responsible behavior on and off
              the mats, leadership and strength of character, and sportsmanship - respect for one&apos;s
              opponents, acceptance of victory with humility, and acknowledgement of defeat with grace.
              By embracing these values, EQUIPE GB members create habits which will lead to a better
              lifestyle and well-being. While winning is not an end in itself, at Gracie Barra North York
              we believe that the efforts by our athletes to be their best will lead them to succeed
              throughout their lives.

                We all should learn from our past to educate the future. The pictures on the walls of
                every Gracie Barra School tell our story from the early twentieth century to today.
                First in line, Mitsuyo Maeda, the Japanese with unparalleled skill who brought the
                gentle art to Brazil. Next, Carlos Gracie Sr., Maeda&apos;s first student and the first
                Gracie to ever learn Jiu-Jitsu. Third, HÃ©lio Gracie, Carlos&apos; brother and the best
                Gracie fighter of his time. Fourth, Rolls Gracie, a true jiu jitsu innovator and
                champion of Brazilian jiu jitsu philosophy. And finally, Carlos Gracie, Jr., the
                founder of Gracie Barra, and the visionary of the Jiu-Jitsu for everyone project. Its
                our tradition of recollecting the lives of great Masters and practitioners, both as a
                mark of gratitude and appreciation, and as a source of inspiration from which we may
                still learn.

                In times of trouble, or when we have a challenge ahead, we know the importance of
                family and friends. In the sporting arena is no different. Whenever an athlete enters
                the arena of competition, the positive energy of the crowd is contagious and makes
                it can make his performance grow.
                <br />
                <br />
                To prove that our motto is true and show that we really are organized as a team and we
                fight like family, Gracie Barra calls all who carry the Red Shield GB on their chest to
                unite in one crowd, supporting our competitors with a unique energy coming from different
                neighborhoods, cities, states and even countries.
                <br />
                <br />
                Therefore, in the next competition look around in the venue and find the ones wearing
                the red shirts or holding the Gracie Barra flag and join this family, your family, and
                this increasingly strong support, which is only going to keep growing. The harmony
                between the schools will help Gracie Barra become even greater.
